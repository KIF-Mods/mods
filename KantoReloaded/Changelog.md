KANTO RELOADED
Update #4 - Shifting Skies
v1.4.1
Release Date: August 3, 2026
══════════════════════════════════════════════

SUMMARY
-------
This update introduces persistent regional weather and forecasting with battle integration, custom ambience, and multiplayer safeguards while improving Wild Link previews and Overworld Menu responsiveness.

FEATURES
--------
• Added a regional Weather System with persistent climate-based or fully random weather cells, weather forecasts, Overworld Menu forecast views, and battle-weather integration
• Added a global Wild Link Sprites option for switching detail previews between Pokémon icons and full battle sprites

IMPROVEMENTS
------------
• Improved the Overworld Menu so map graphics and world-time updates continue while the overlay and its popups are open
• Improved Wild Link opening so the initially selected row's Pokémon preview is loaded before the completed scene becomes visible

BUG FIXES
---------
• Fixed authored Wild Link Rare Signals being remapped by encounter and Static Encounter randomization instead of matching the live Poké Radar-exclusive species
• Fixed Wild Link invoking KIF's popup-producing battle randomizer while building roster rows; static encounter results are now resolved directly without repeated error prompts
• Fixed Wild Link repeatedly presenting stale loading frames and requiring additional button presses before the completed scene appeared
• Fixed Wild Link fusion previews collapsing to the shared icon 000 placeholder and Seen species remaining black silhouettes
• Fixed Wild Link detail previews inheriting Big Icons, miscomposing valid species with fallback fusion components, shrinking unintended full battle sprites into icon-sized space, failing to resolve exact fusion icons, and allowing invalid species to display KIF's Pikachu fallback; previews now use Pokémon icon assets by default

VISUALS & UI
------------
• Added non-pausing upper-left alerts for local Weather System changes

AUDIO
-----
• Added optional continuous rain, storm, and heavy-rain ambience to the Weather System with randomized thunder timing and independent rain and thunder audio toggles

PERFORMANCE
-----------
• Removed first-open Wild Link stalls caused by constructing complete fusion battle data for roster rows; fusion names, Pokédex keys, and icon paths now use lightweight references, previews load only after active row focus, and completed scenes are presented immediately
• Packed 2,302 Wild Link fusion follower graphics into two lazily opened ZIP-compatible `.pak` archives, reducing update file count while preserving on-demand normal and shiny silhouettes

TECHNICAL
---------
• Added guarded PvP weather negotiation that synchronizes initiator battle weather only when both clients confirm Kanto Reloaded support and suppresses unsynchronized local weather in co-op

DEVELOPER
---------
• Added a data-only Weather System map override registry for eligibility, cell grouping, climate, and forecast-label exceptions

KANTO RELOADED
Update #3 - Signals & Supplies
v1.3.2
Release Date: July 27, 2026
══════════════════════════════════════════════

SUMMARY
-------
This update strengthens Wild Link with more accurate randomized rosters, safer field targets, clearer progression details, and faster previews while expanding Mart bulk-purchase rewards and reducing Double Abilities battle overhead.

FEATURES
--------
• Added deterministic Rare Signal species targeting roughly 50 BST above the route average on maps without authored Poké Radar encounters

IMPROVEMENTS
------------
• File A Bug Report now uploads and copies separate links for both the sanitized bug report and full current log

BALANCE
-------
• Added one Potion per 10 Super Potions, Hyper Potions, or Max Potions purchased in a single transaction

BUG FIXES
---------
• Fixed chance-based and forced wild fusions being persisted in Wild Link rosters instead of showing only fusions supplied by randomized encounter tables
• Fixed Wild Link Surf searches selecting bridge tiles, placing overworld Pokemon on land, and launching battles from map updates in a way that could cause white-screen crashes
• Fixed Dynamic Pokemon encounters expanding Wild Link's persistent searchable roster
• Fixed Wild Link omitting KIF's final Static Encounter mapping from randomized table, Rare Signal, and generic Rock Smash fallback species
• Fixed Wild Link showing authored encounter species instead of KIF's effective Global or Area randomized encounter roster
• Expanded per-10 Premier Ball and DNA Reverser purchase rewards to regular marts
• Fixed bug reports omitting errors that had fallen outside the newest 300 log lines
• Fixed Wild Link hiding valid Surf encounter tables until the player was already surfing
• Fixed Wild Link omitting KIF's generic Geodude fallback on maps with smash rocks but no authored Rock Smash table
• Fixed Wild Link placement failures being hidden when Messages was Off
• Fixed fusion component evolution replacing still-legal Double Abilities with KIF's post-evolution ability-index result
• Fixed active Wild Link Rock Smash indicators remaining owned by the previous map spriteset and crashing during map transfers
• Fixed Wild Link combining Morning, Day, and Night species instead of showing KIF's currently active time-based encounter table

VISUALS & UI
------------
• Added live bulk-purchase reward previews to Reloaded Shop and standard Mart purchase confirmations
• Added per-method Seen and Caught completion counters to the Wild Link header
• Added KR purchase-reward prompts showing how many bonus items were added in Reloaded Shop and regular marts
• Added Input Z switching between Wild Link Search Level information and Current Bonuses for inactive links and active targets
• Replaced Wild Link's ambiguous Potential label with the generated target's exact perfect-IV count
• Highlighted unresolved Wild Link Rare Signals and revealed rare-species roster rows in gold
• Replaced missing Wild Link overworld graphics with Pikachu while preserving fully black silhouettes for unknown targets

PERFORMANCE
-----------
• Reduced Wild Link roster redraw work by caching row display data and moving cursor pulsing onto a dedicated sprite layer
• Cached stable Double Abilities battler eligibility, secondary ability resolution, and legal-pair validation instead of repeating species-data work across battle handlers

TECHNICAL
---------
• Added scoped Dynamic Pokemon suppression so Wild Link can resolve stable native randomizer mappings without consuming a Dynamic encounter roll

DEVELOPER
---------
• Added a Wild Link Gather Map Data diagnostic exporter for current-map metadata, terrain, field events, eligibility, and encounter tables
